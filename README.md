# Smart-Pet-Tracker
This project focuses on developing a wearable device and a companion mobile app to monitor a dogâ€™s health and activities. It tracks walking, running, sleeping, and eating habits using an IMU sensor and monitors environmental conditions with a temperature sensor. BLE ensures low-power data transmission, while Wi-Fi enables remote syncing. The mobile app displays activity reports, health insights, and real-time alerts. Six engineers collaborated on the design and development. The goal is to enhance pet well-being through data-driven insights and proactive monitoring. Real-time notifications support early detection of health issues. The solution empowers owners to make informed decisions. Overall, it strengthens the bond between pets and their owners.
